        "question": "Can I control what gets clipped and how accounts look?",
        "answer": "Yes. During onboarding you set the rules — account style, which streams to clip, any content guidelines. We follow your direction exactly. If something doesn't feel right, let us know and we'll fix it immediately."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to give you access to my social media accounts?",
        "answer": "Never. We create and manage dedicated clip accounts built around your channel. Your personal accounts stay 100% in your control — no passwords, no access needed. You approve the setup during onboarding and we handle the rest."

        "question": "Is there a minimum contract or can I cancel anytime?",

      },
      {
        "question": "I'm a small streamer — is this worth it for me?",
        "answer": "Yes — and you might see the biggest growth. Short-form clips introduce you to audiences who'd never find your stream otherwise. Many of our best success stories started with under 50 average viewers."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the clips actually feel like my brand?",
        "answer": "That's non-negotiable for us. We study your stream style, humor, and audience during onboarding — then match you with clippers who genuinely get your content. If a clip ever feels off-brand, flag it and we adjust instantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my growth doesn't improve?",
        "answer": "You'll always see exactly what's happening through transparent analytics. If results aren't where they should be, we adjust — different clip styles, posting times, or platforms. Most streamers see measurable growth within 2-4 weeks."
